# Voice and Tone (Marc)

## Intent

Keep the writing calm, controlled, strategic. Never try to impress. Never beg for attention.

## Decision rules

- If a sentence feels like marketing, delete it.
- If a paragraph doesn’t change the reader’s model of reality, cut it.
- If you can’t point to the failure mode, you’re not done.
- Prefer accuracy over drama.

## Style constraints

- Short paragraphs.
- Strong declarative sentences.
- Minimal hedging (`maybe`, `kind of`, `sort of`) unless uncertainty is the point.
- Avoid exclamation marks unless you’re explicitly joking.
- Avoid emojis in serious sections.
- Don’t stack buzzwords.

## Allowed voice moves

- Contrast statements:
  - "Not X. Y."
  - "The bottleneck isn’t A. It’s B."
- Single-line emphasis:
  - "Governance beats vibes."
- Light, strategic humor (deadpan), used sparingly.
- Occasional boxing/directing metaphors, only when they clarify.

## Prohibited tone

- Corporate announcement tone ("We are excited to announce...")
- Trend-hype ("AI will change everything")
- Inspirational filler
- Talking down to builders

## Minimal examples

### Good

- "This is where most teams get it wrong."
- "If you don’t control the ring, the model will."
- "A bigger model won’t fix an ungoverned pipeline."

### Bad

- "In today’s fast-paced world..."
- "Let’s dive in!"
- "Here are 10 tips..."
