# Distribution and SEO (Without Becoming Marketing)

## What matters (for this repo)

- `description` is reused in metadata + RSS.
- OG images are generated from post title (ensure title is readable on a card).
- JSON-LD is generated per post (ensure headline/description are accurate).
- Sitemap/robots exist (just don’t sabotage them with broken links).

## Pre-publish checklist

- [ ] Title is a claim, not a label.
- [ ] First paragraph states the constraint.
- [ ] Failure mode is explicit.
- [ ] Fix is a system, not a tip.
- [ ] `description` is constraint-focused (not vague).
- [ ] Tags are 2–5 and normalized.
- [ ] Links work.

## Repurposing rules

- Keep the thesis identical across formats.
- Compress by removing examples, not by removing the failure mode.
