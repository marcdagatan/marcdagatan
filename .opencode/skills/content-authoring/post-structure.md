# Post Structure (Canonical Arc)

## Default arc

1. **Problem observed** (real, concrete)
2. **Failure mode** (what actually breaks, why)
3. **Reframe** (zoom out; define the real constraint)
4. **System-level fix** (control plane, routing, constraints)
5. **Implications** (for builders/founders)
6. **Positioning** (subtle: what you built / what you learned)

## Section sizing rules

- If a section can’t be summarized in 1 sentence, it’s bloated.
- Prefer 2–5 sentences per paragraph.
- Use lists only to compress complexity, not to create fluff.

## Headings guidance

- Headings should read like claims, not labels.
  - Prefer: "Why prompts don’t scale"
  - Avoid: "Background" / "Overview"

## Minimal examples

### Outline template

- Title: _[thesis with bite]_
- Hook: 1–2 sentences, constraint-focused
- The observed problem
- The failure mode
- The reframe
- The control-plane fix
- What changes for builders
- Closing: one crisp rule

### Failure-mode paragraph template

"The system fails when **[trigger]** happens.
Not because **[surface cause]**.
Because **[root cause / missing constraint]**."
