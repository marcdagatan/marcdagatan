# Recipe: New Post (MDX)

## When to use

- Creating a new `content/posts/*.mdx` file.

## Constraints

- Keep it Markdown-first.
- Default arc: problem → failure mode → reframe → fix → implications.

## Template

```mdx
---
title: "[Thesis as a claim]"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm AM/PM"
description: "[Constraint + why it matters, 120–180 chars]"
tags: ["ai", "governance"]
---

[Hook: 1–2 sentences. State the constraint.]

## The observed problem

## The failure mode

## The reframe

## The system-level fix

## What changes for builders

## Closing rule
```

## Minimal example

"You don’t need a bigger model. You need a smaller box it can’t escape."
