# Recipe: Repurpose Post → Thread

## When to use

- Turning a full post into a short, high-signal thread while keeping the thesis intact.

## Format

- 6–10 bullets max.
- Each bullet is a claim or a causal step.
- No filler transitions.

## Minimal template

1. "[Thesis]"
2. "The failure mode: [what breaks]."
3. "Why it breaks: [missing constraint]."
4. "Reframe: [what’s actually being optimized]."
5. "Fix: [control plane / routing / constraints]."
6. "Implication: [what builders should do next]."
