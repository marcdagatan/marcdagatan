There’s no polite way to put it—I am not a fan of the new _Superman_ film.

I get the point. It _wants_ to be fun, colorful, grounding, human. The idea has potential. But the execution? Brutal. The only thing that really worked was Green Lantern and the graphics. That’s not how a Superman movie should feel.

Here’s the problem:

- The **acting** is stiff across the board. No one sells the weight of the story, least of all the guy in the cape.
- The **plot pacing** is on overdrive, sprinting from scene to scene like it’s terrified you’ll check your phone if there’s a quiet moment.
- The **emotional beats** try to hit, but they’re shallow. Case in point: that rushed dinner scene that suddenly turns into an interview, as if Superman’s vulnerability could be proven through a flash of anger. It didn’t feel human—it felt staged.
- And the **best part of the film wasn’t even Superman.** It was Green Lantern being an unapologetic asshole—and somehow pulling it off without effort. The guy stole the whole movie just by existing.

Now, some people will swear they loved it. Here’s why:

1. It’s shiny and fast. Quick cuts and CGI keep your brain buzzing.
2. It ticks surface-level “fun” boxes: jokes, upbeat soundtrack, a “relatable” Superman.
3. Nostalgia goggles. Just seeing him on screen is enough for some.
4. Social influence. Nobody wants to be the downer when Twitter’s calling it _“the Superman we’ve been waiting for.”_

But let’s be honest. That’s a sugar high. Once the buzz wears off, there’s no real meal underneath.

### Humanizing a God

Here’s the thing—they clearly wanted to give Superman the _Thor treatment._ Show how human, awkward, and funny a godlike character can be. On paper, not a bad idea. The problem? _Thor actually pulled it off._

Chris Hemsworth sells the humor without losing the weight of who Thor is. Even in the goofier films, you still feel the god underneath the jokes. Superman in this film? Just flat. The humor doesn’t hit, the humanity feels forced, and instead of charming, it comes off like he’s trying way too hard to be someone he’s not.

Thor had timing. Thor had chemistry. Thor had a balance of myth and man. This Superman? He just had punchlines.

### The Core Truth

I’m not here to dictate what Superman _should_ be. If they want to make him funnier, more human, more colorful—great. I’m all for it. I get the goal.

The problem is execution. James Gunn brought us _Guardians of the Galaxy_—a misfit crew, bright colors, humor, and heart. That worked. This film is trying to bring that same magic to Superman. But instead of feeling effortless, it feels like imitation.

And when the magic doesn’t hit, all that’s left is a movie that looks the part but never really _feels_ it.

Because honestly? The only thing I walked out remembering was Green Lantern—being a complete jerk, owning every scene, and doing it without even trying. And that says everything.
