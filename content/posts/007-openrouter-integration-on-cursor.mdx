So you're ready to unlock custom models in Cursor, eh? Good. Here's exactly how to plug in OpenRouter.ai so you can run stuff like `z-ai/glm-4.5` directly inside your coding flow.

Follow these steps carefully, or you’ll just end up confused and yelling at your terminal.

### 🚀 Step-by-Step: Integrating OpenRouter.ai into Cursor

1. **Open Cursor Settings**  
   Click the gear icon (bottom-left). Yes, the thing you’ve ignored until now.

2. **Navigate to Models**  
   Once inside settings, go to the **Models** section.

3. **Disable ALL Current Models**  
   That’s right. *Every single one*. Disable anything that’s checked or active.

4. **Scroll Down to `> Api Keys`**  
   You’ll find a collapsible section labeled `> Api Keys`. Click it to expand.

5. **Override the OpenAI Base URL**  
   Under the **OpenAI API Key** area:
   - Check the box that says **Override OpenAI Base URL**
   - Paste this into the field:  

     ```
     https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
     ```

6. **Find the Right Model Name**  
   This part *matters*. Go to [https://openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models).  
   Find the proper name of the model you want to use — for example: `z-ai/glm-4.5`.  
   You’ll need to type it *exactly* like that when adding a new model.

7. **Add the Model in Cursor**  
   Back in Cursor:
   - Click **Add New Model**
   - Paste the model name from OpenRouter (e.g., `z-ai/glm-4.5`)
   - Save it

8. **Add Your OpenRouter API Key**  
   Paste your API key into the **OpenAI API Key** section.  
   Then hit **Verify**.

   If everything goes well, you’ll see something like:
   > With your cursor Pro+ subscription, you do not need to use your own OpenAI key unless you're using custom models.

9. **Test the Integration**  
   Open the Cursor chat and try talking to your newly added model.  
   If it replies, congrats — you’re golden.

### ✅ Bonus Tips

- You can add *multiple* models from OpenRouter.ai now.
- Check out **`z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free`** — it’s one of the free models and surprisingly solid.

> ⚠️ Heads up: Free-tier models may use your prompts and completions as training data. So… maybe don’t use them for your nuclear launch codes.

Happy hacking.
