It’s **11 PM on a Sunday**.  
Most people are winding down. Netflix, family, maybe a glass of wine.  
Me? I’m staring into the abyss of a codebase that feels like it was cobbled together during a caffeine-induced fever dream.

Every function I open smells like panic.  
Every file I touch unravels into a rabbit hole of **WTF** moments.  
And the cruel part? This isn’t my mess — but I _am_ the one cleaning it.

And the reason I’m here, at this ungodly hour, is simple:  
**I hired wrong.**

## The First Mistake

One of them was a former colleague.  
We’d crossed paths in a previous company — me as a Tech Lead, him as… well, not my direct report, but in the same orbit. Later, we became actual teammates in another gig.

I’d seen enough of his work to know it wasn’t flawless. He had “quirks.” He needed handholding. He could be a burden on momentum.  
But here’s where I got soft:

> “Maybe this time will be different. Maybe he’s grown.”

That optimism? It was me writing a check my future self couldn’t cash.

## The Rot Spreads

Bad hires are like mold — they don’t just sit there quietly. They creep. They set a tone. They lower the bar for _everything_.

Enter the second engineer. She came in as an aftershock of the first bad decision. I didn’t vet her as much. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I thought, _how much worse could it get?_

Spoiler: worse.

By the time the dust settled, the “app” we were left with was an elaborate house of cards built on a swamp. **Every quick fix was a ticking time bomb.** Every “temporary solution” was a permanent liability.

This wasn’t a refactor job. This was a **demolition**.

## The Real Cost of Hiring Wrong

Hiring badly doesn’t just drain a budget. It **steals your life**.

It eats weekends. It eats your evenings.  
It eats at your reputation — which, for me, is currency. I’ve built my name on delivering high-quality software. One of the best engineers in the Philippines? That’s the rep I’ve fought for.

But here’s the ugly truth: when bad code ships, no one remembers who wrote it. They remember **who’s holding the bag when it breaks**.  
And right now, that’s me.

## The Red Flags I Ignored

I’m not telling you this to vent (okay, maybe a little).  
I’m telling you because if you ignore these, you’ll find yourself in my chair at 11 PM on a Sunday.

### 1. **History repeats itself.**

If they were a drain before, they’ll be a drain again — especially under pressure. Hoping otherwise is not leadership. It’s gambling.

### 2. **Friendship ≠ competence.**

Being likable doesn’t mean being capable. You can enjoy someone’s company and still not trust them with your codebase.

### 3. **One bad hire is two hires lost.**

A weak player doesn’t just underperform — they drag standards down so far that more weak hires slip through. The damage compounds.

### 4. **Vet like your life depends on it.**

Because in some ways, it does. Trial projects, technical audits, uncomfortable questions — these aren’t “nice to haves.” They are the moat around your sanity.

## The High Point: The Moment I Snapped

It happened around 3 AM one night.  
I was knee-deep in some **critical payment module** that should have been bulletproof. Instead, I found logic that made less sense than a fever dream.

That was my _snap_ moment.  
Not because I had to fix it — I’ve fixed worse.  
But because I realized every single bug, every single late night, every single headache was self-inflicted.

I didn’t just inherit a mess.  
I had _paid_ to bring the mess into my life.

## The Wisdom (Paid in Blood, Sweat, and Sunday Nights)

If you’re building a team:

- **You are the gatekeeper.** Every hire you make alters the DNA of your company.
- **Never hire out of desperation.** Short-handed is better than poisoned from within.
- **Your gut is your early-warning system.** If something feels off, it _is_ off.
- **Hope is not a strategy.** “Maybe they’ve improved” is how you end up cleaning code at midnight.

## The Bang: Your Company Lives or Dies by Who You Let In

Hiring is leverage.  
Do it right, and your company flies.  
Do it wrong, and you will spend your life cleaning up problems you paid other people to create.

So guard your gates.  
Ask the hard questions.  
Be ruthless about who gets in.

Because once they’re inside, the damage they can do isn’t just technical — it’s **personal**.

And trust me: you do not want to be the one staring down a bug-riddled nightmare at 11 PM on a Sunday, wondering why you didn’t listen to your gut the first time.
