Every fight starts the same way.  
The bell rings. The crowd roars. And for a split second, it’s just you, your breath, and the decision to step forward.

Life works exactly the same way — except you don’t always hear the bell.  
Sometimes, you realize you’re already mid-round, taking hits you didn’t see coming. Other times, you’re staring at an opponent you didn’t ask for, wondering why you’re even in the ring.

I’m Marc — founder of MAD Software, fighter, actor, and dad. My life’s been this strange mix of **business meetings, boxing rounds, film scripts, and parenting moments** that don’t come with a manual.

And this blog exists because I’ve lived enough _canon events_ to know the value of sharing them — even if the stories aren’t easy to hear, even if the lessons aren’t easy to swallow.

### **Why I’m Here**

I’ve been the underdog with nothing but stubbornness in my corner.  
I’ve been the guy everyone bets against… until they stop.  
I’ve built things people swore would fail, only to watch those same people try to reverse-engineer them later.  
I’ve also failed spectacularly — the kind of failure you don’t post about, the kind that forces you to look at yourself in a mirror you can’t lie to.

I’ve stood under bright lights in the ring, feeling the weight of the crowd and the sound of my own breathing.  
I’ve stood under different lights in front of a camera, knowing the scene isn’t just acting — it’s me drawing from every scar, every fight, every heartbreak.

Acting has this strange way of making you _see yourself_. You can’t hide. You bring your truths, your flaws, your victories — or the audience will smell the fake from a mile away. Business is no different. Boxing is no different. Life is no different.

### **What This Blog Is — and Isn’t**

If you’re here for pretty quotes, curated desk setups, or “5 Steps to Guaranteed Success” — this isn’t the place.

This blog is a corner of the internet where:

- I talk about building companies without the safety net of a degree, connections, or endless capital.
- I break down how boxing taught me more about business, relationships, and resilience than any book ever could.
- I unpack how acting teaches you to _be present_, to commit fully to a moment, and to channel truth even when it’s uncomfortable.
- I tell the truth about the times I wanted to quit — and the small, ugly, unglamorous decisions that kept me in the fight.

And here’s the thing: I’m not handing out soft-serve inspiration. This isn’t a sugar-coated pep talk.  
Think of it more like a pill — maybe bitter going down, but exactly what you need if you actually want to grow.

### **Why I’m Willing to Tell It All**

I could keep these stories to myself.  
But I’ve seen too many people give up because they thought they were the only ones struggling. Too many smart, talented people talk themselves out of starting because they thought the gap between where they are and where they want to be is too wide.

So, I’m going to tell it all — the moments that shaped me, the missteps that nearly broke me, the plays that changed the game, and the scenes that forced me to dig deeper than I thought I could.

Not because I think I’m special, but because I know what it’s like to wish someone would just tell you the truth.

### **Your First Bell**

Maybe today is yours.  
Maybe this post is your bell.

You might be at the start of something — a business, a fight, a personal war, or maybe even your first scene in front of a camera — heart pounding, lines slipping, wondering if you belong.

Here’s what I’ve learned: you don’t need to have it all figured out. You just need to answer the bell. Step forward. Throw something. Adjust. Keep going.

Because one day, you’ll look back at this moment — sweaty, tired, maybe a little scared — and you’ll realize it’s where everything started to change.

If you’re ready, welcome to the fight.
