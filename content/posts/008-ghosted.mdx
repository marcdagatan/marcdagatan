There was this time I met someone, and it felt like the air shifted. Not in a dramatic, cinematic way — more like one of those small, rare moments when everything just *clicks*. Conversations that flowed like we’d rehearsed them in another lifetime. Jokes that landed without effort. That kind of subtle spark that makes you want to stretch the night a little longer, just to see where it might lead.  

We talked about random things and important things. She’d tease me, I’d tease her back, and underneath the banter was this hum of something deeper. It wasn’t just flirtation — it was recognition. Like, *damn, you get me in a way most people don’t.*  

And then… nothing.  

One day the messages slowed, the next day they stopped. Just like that, she was gone. No fight, no messy ending, not even a flimsy excuse. Just silence where there used to be warmth. And if I’m being real, it hurt more than I expected. Because when you feel something that strong, that quick, your brain wants to crown it as *rare*. Your heart starts writing chapters that never even got drafted.  

But here’s the reality check: **one week is still one week.** The depth I felt was real, but it was mine. It was the *feeling* that was deep, not the foundation. And that difference? That’s the whole lesson.  

So, I had to remind myself: **don’t romanticize the ghost.** Disappearing without a word isn’t mysterious or tragic — it’s just a lack of courage. If someone can’t give you the bare minimum of honesty, they weren’t the “meant to be” you thought they were.  

Instead, I chose to **transmute the lesson.** The ache reminded me of what I want — not just chemistry, but communication. Not just late-night banter, but consistency. Because even a simple, awkward, *“Hey, I don’t feel the same way”* is a gift compared to silence.  

The ghost is gone, but the fire remains. That spark I felt wasn’t proof she was special — it was proof *I* can feel deeply, show up fully, and risk getting burned. And honestly? That’s a strength worth keeping.  

**The takeaway?** We’ll flirt, we’ll meet people who light us up, and sometimes we’ll lose them just as quickly. That doesn’t make the story meaningless. It just makes it a short story instead of a novel. And sometimes, short stories still teach you the most.
